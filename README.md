# Music-Recommendation-System
It's a prototype for a music recommendation system different from other systems. Most traditional systems are not very transparent about why a recommendation is made, and seem like magical black boxes. What sets apart this customizable music recommendation system from the rest, is that it aims to clearly convey the reason behind each recommendation, and put all the control in the hands of the user so that they can pick and choose what kind of recommendations they'd like, and hence personalize the system just as user or they need.
